# Ride Log

This repository is a personal log of daily ride activity.

The goal is consistency, not performance.
Rides are logged as they happen, with minimal friction.

This repo serves as:
- memory
- maintenance history
- reflection tool

External platforms:
- Strava → activity data
- Intervals.icu → fitness context
- Instagram → storytelling

The streak is a side effect.
Health is the priority.
