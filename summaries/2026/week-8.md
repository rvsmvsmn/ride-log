# Weekly Summary — Week 08 (2026-02-16 → 2026-02-22)

## Overview
- Days ridden: 7 / 7
- Primary bike: momon105 (outdoor)
- Indoor bike: mawmaw1s
- Theme: Transition from recovery to build-ready

Week 08 marked the completion of post-race recovery and entry into a fresh, stable state. Fatigue declined steadily while consistency was maintained.

No structured intensity block was introduced yet. Riding remained mostly aerobic, with one spontaneous higher-effort commute earlier in the week.

## Totals
- Total distance: ~185 km
- Total elevation gain: ~312 m

Daily breakdown:
- 2026-02-16: 31.90 km / 0 m (indoor)
- 2026-02-17: 10.98 km / 35 m
- 2026-02-18: 25.40 km / 58 m

## Fitness Trend

Start of Week 08:
- CTL: 55
- ATL: 58
- Form: -3

End of Week 08:
- CTL: 52
- ATL: 42
- Form: +10
- Ramp: negative (load consolidation)

Interpretation:
Fatigue reduced significantly while CTL decreased slightly due to reduced training stress during recovery. Form moved from slightly negative to strongly positive (+10), indicating full recovery and high freshness.

This week completed the race absorption cycle.

---

## Effort Distribution
- Easy aerobic: majority
- Moderate intensity: limited (commute push on Feb 18)
- Structured intervals: none

Intensity was not stacked, and no fatigue spike occurred after higher effort days.

---

## Key Observations

1. Full recovery achieved within 8–9 days post-race.
2. Explosiveness and HR responsiveness returned mid-week.
3. No lingering systemic fatigue.
4. CTL slightly declining due to reduced load.
5. Form entering performance-ready territory.

The system is now fresh but underloaded.

## Reflection

Week 08 was controlled and disciplined. The focus was on allowing adaptation to finalize without prematurely chasing performance. Recovery was clean, metrics stable, and consistency maintained.

The next phase should shift from maintenance to intentional build.

---

## Looking Ahead

- Introduce structured tempo or muscular endurance work.
- Increase weekly load gradually (8–12%).
- Prevent CTL decay by adding purposeful stress.
- Avoid sudden ramp spikes to preserve stability.

> Freshness without direction leads to stagnation.
> Controlled stress creates progression.
