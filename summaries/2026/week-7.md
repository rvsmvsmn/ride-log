## Overview
- Days ridden: 7 / 7
- Primary bike: momon105 (commutes)
- Indoor bike: mawmaw1s
- Theme: Absorption and controlled recovery

Week 07 focused on stabilizing after the 200 km race. The objective was not performance, but allowing fatigue to decline while maintaining daily riding consistency.

No attempts were made to force intensity. All riding remained controlled and aerobic.

## Fitness Trend

Race peak (Feb 8):
- ATL: 117
- Form: -57

End of Week 07:
- CTL: 55
- ATL: 62
- Form: -8
- Ramp: negative (consolidation phase)

Interpretation:
Fatigue declined smoothly and predictably throughout the week. No secondary fatigue spike occurred, indicating the race effort was well-paced and absorbed properly.

Form moved from deeply negative (-57) to near-neutral (-8) within 7 days, suggesting strong recovery capacity.

---

## Effort Distribution
- Easy aerobic: 7 days
- Structured intensity: 0
- Unplanned surges: minimal and incidental

There was no stacking of hard efforts during recovery week.

---

## Key Observations

1. Explosive power remained suppressed mid-week but endurance felt normal.
2. Heart rate trends stabilized quickly.
3. No signs of lingering systemic fatigue.
4. Daily consistency maintained without overreaching.

The week confirms that the 200 km race created acute fatigue, not chronic overload.

---

## Reflection

Week 07 was successful because it did not attempt to chase performance. The focus remained on stability and discipline. Fatigue reduction was linear and controlled, with no emotional or ego-driven riding.

Durability remains intact. Neuromuscular sharpness is returning gradually.

---

## Looking Ahead

- Form approaching neutral suggests readiness for light tempo reintroduction.
- Avoid jumping directly to high-intensity work.
- Gradual muscular endurance stimulus recommended before anaerobic efforts.

> Recovery is not passive — it is structured restraint.
