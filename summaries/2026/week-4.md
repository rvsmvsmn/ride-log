# Weekly Summary — Week 04 (2026-01-19 → 2026-01-25)

## Overview
- **Days ridden:** 7 / 7
- **Primary bike:** momon105
- **Theme:** Absorption, recovery under weather constraints, controlled stimulus

This week emphasized sustainability: frequent commuting, rain-managed recovery rides, and one deliberate climbing stimulus without chasing volume.

---

## Totals
- **Total distance:** 174.70 km
- **Total elevation gain:** 756 m

Breakdown:
- 2026-01-19: 25.59 km / 61 m  
- 2026-01-20: 25.69 km / 61 m  
- 2026-01-21: 7.70 km / 20 m  
- 2026-01-22: 51.71 km / 79 m  
- 2026-01-23: 25.57 km / 64 m  
- 2026-01-24: 9.75 km / 26 m  
- 2026-01-25: 27.29 km / 288 m

## Effort Distribution
- **Very easy / easy:** 5 days  
- **Steady:** 2 days  
- **Hard (uncontrolled):** 0 days  

Most intensity spikes were situational (steep climb, group dynamics) rather than planned overreaching.

---

## Heart Rate & Load
- Average HR mostly ranged **110–125 bpm**
- Highest peak HR: **177 bpm** (steep climb on Jan 25)
- Lowest recovery day: **95 bpm** (Jan 21, rain spin)

Despite lower weekly volume, cardiovascular response stayed efficient, indicating good fatigue absorption from previous weeks.

---

## Bike State & Maintenance
- Rear tire (OBO Fire Bolt) and brake shoes (Baradine) continued early-life usage
- Multiple wet-road days increased contamination risk
- One deliberate choice to **wipe only** instead of full wash (Jan 22), followed by no negative drivetrain symptoms

No equipment degradation observed.

---

## Conditions
- Frequent rain or wet roads across the week
- Several rides opportunistically timed around rain gaps
- Urban traffic during commutes; reduced group activity due to conditions

Weather dictated *when* and *how*, not *whether*, rides happened.

---

## Reflection
This was a **quietly strong week**:
- You downshifted volume without breaking rhythm
- Recovery rides were real, not symbolic
- One steep climb provided neuromuscular stimulus without cascading fatigue

This is exactly how long-term streaks survive bad weather.

---

## Looking Ahead
- Expect volume to rise again naturally as weather stabilizes
- Keep easy days truly easy after group or climb efforts
- Monitor drivetrain cleanliness after wet weeks
- No need to “make up”
