# Monthly Summary — February 2026

## Overview

February 2026 was defined by a major endurance effort and a textbook recovery cycle.

The month began with normal training load, peaked with a 200 km race (219 km total on race day), and transitioned into a controlled recovery phase followed by full freshness restoration.

Consistency remained intact throughout the month.

Days ridden: 28 / 28

## Key Event

### 2026-02-08 — 200 km Race
- 219.72 km
- 2529 m elevation gain
- 10:36:23 moving time
- Avg HR: 150 bpm
- Max HR: 178 bpm

This race created:
- ATL peak: 117
- Form low: -57
- CTL peak: ~60

It was the highest single stress event of the year so far.

---

## Recovery Cycle

Post-race fatigue declined smoothly:

ATL progression:
117 → 105 → 95 → 85 → 77 → 71 → 65 → 62 → 58 → 52 → 50 → 46 → 42 → 38 → 36

Form progression:
-57 → -45 → -36 → -27 → -20 → -15 → -9 → -8 → -3 → +2 → +7 → +10 → +13

Full functional recovery achieved within ~9–10 days.

No secondary fatigue spike occurred.

This confirms:
- Race pacing was controlled
- Fueling was effective
- Recovery management was disciplined

---

## Monthly Totals (Approximate)

- Total distance: ~950–1000 km
- Longest ride: 219.72 km
- Highest elevation day: 2529 m
- Longest moving time: 10h 36m

Indoor sessions increased during recovery phase.

## Fitness Trend

Start of month:
- CTL: high 50s
- Moderate fatigue

Race peak:
- CTL: ~60
- ATL: 117
- Form: -57

End of month:
- CTL: 49
- ATL: 36
- Form: +13

CTL declined during recovery due to reduced structured load.

The system is now:
- Fully fresh
- Slightly underloaded
- Ready to build

---

## Strengths Observed

1. Exceptional durability over 200 km.
2. Strong aerobic base — endurance remained stable post-race.
3. Predictable recovery pattern.
4. No emotional overreaching during recovery.
5. Maintained 100% daily riding consistency.

---

## Development Opportunities

1. Reduce torque fatigue during long climbs (slightly higher cadence strategy).
2. Introduce structured tempo earlier after recovery.
3. Prevent CTL decay post-event by earlier load reintroduction.

---

## Reflection

February demonstrates maturity in load management.

The race did not break the system.  
The recovery did not drift into inactivity.  
The transition into freshness was controlled and deliberate.

The month ends not fatigued — but ready.

---

## Looking Ahead (March)

March should focus on:
- Gradual CTL rebuild (target 56–60 range)
- Muscular endurance refinement
- Controlled tempo development
- Cadence flexibility improvement

> February was durability.
> March should be development.
