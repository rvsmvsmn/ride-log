# Weekly Summary — Week 06 (2026-02-02 → 2026-02-08)

## Overview
- Days ridden: 7 / 7
- Primary bike: momon105
- Indoor bike: mawmaw1s
- Theme: Taper, execution, and controlled overload

Week 06 was structured around a single objective: arriving at Sunday’s 200 km race healthy, calm, and ready. The week successfully balanced daily riding with freshness preservation, culminating in a large but intentional load spike.

---

## Totals
- Total distance: ~402 km
- Total elevation gain: ~2,850 m

Daily breakdown:
- 2026-02-02: 3.49 km / 0 m (indoor recovery)
- 2026-02-03: 40.90 km / 63 m (mixed indoor + commute)
- 2026-02-04: 38.49 km / 57 m (mixed indoor + commute)
- 2026-02-05: ~40 km / ~60 m (mixed indoor + commute)
- 2026-02-06: 37.44 km / 60 m (indoor + commute)
- 2026-02-07: 43.19 km / 148 m (pre-race activation)
- 2026-02-08: 225.24 km / 2588 m (race day)

## Effort Distribution
- Very easy / Easy: 5 days
- Hard (intentional): 1 day
- Mixed (activation + social): 1 day
- Uncontrolled hard days: 0

All intensity was either deliberate or incidental. There was no stacking of hard efforts before race day.

---

## Fitness Trend
- CTL: Increased sharply (≈47 → 60)
- ATL: Spiked heavily on race day
- Form: Shifted from positive (+3) to deeply negative (-57)
- Ramp behavior: Very high due to race-day load

Interpretation:
- The week functioned as a classic taper + overload pattern
- Negative Form at week close was expected and appropriate
- No signs of premature fatigue prior to race day

---

## Weather Impact
- Mixed conditions throughout the week
- Several rainy days required indoor substitutions
- Race day conditions varied across the route

Weather influenced execution choices but did not disrupt consistency or preparation.

---

## Bike State & Maintenance
- momon105 handled high-distance and high-elevation load without issues
- mawmaw1s used daily for indoor maintenance and recovery rides
- Post-race inspection recommended due to long braking and drivetrain exposure

Component tracking remains intact.

---

## Reflection
Week 06 demonstrated disciplined restraint. Daily riding continued, but volume and intensity were consciously reduced to protect race readiness. The Sunday race was executed as planned: finished cleanly, without crisis, and without compromising the broader system.

The resulting fatigue spike is not a failure of control, but evidence that the stimulus landed as intended.

---

## Looking Ahead
- Prioritize absorption and recovery early in Week 07
- Maintain daily rhythm with very low intensity
- Avoid interpreting short-term fatigue as loss of fitness

> This week was about execution, not accumulation.
