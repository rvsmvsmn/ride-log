# Weekly Summary — Week 05 (2026-01-26 → 2026-02-01)

## Overview
- Days ridden: 7 / 7
- Primary bike: momon105
- Theme: Transition from absorption to stimulus under difficult conditions

Week 05 closed January and opened February in a single arc: conservative riding under heavy rain, followed by a deliberate high-load climbing day to reset stimulus.

---

## Totals
- Total distance: ~250 km
- Total elevation gain: ~2,030 m

Daily breakdown:
- 2026-01-26: 25.57 km / 61 m  
- 2026-01-27: 25.53 km / 60 m  
- 2026-01-28: 27.85 km / 131 m  
- 2026-01-29: 25.80 km / 59 m  
- 2026-01-30: 52.55 km / 197 m  
- 2026-01-31: 6.79 km / 14 m  
- 2026-02-01: 86.18 km / 1507 m

## Effort Distribution
- Easy / very easy: 4 days  
- Steady: 2 days  
- Hard (intentional): 1 day  
- Uncontrolled hard days: 0  

Intensity was restrained for most of the week, allowing capacity to be used deliberately at the end.

---

## Fitness Trend
- CTL: Increased slightly (≈47 → 50)
- ATL: Rose sharply at week end
- Form: Shifted from positive to negative (-7) on the final day
- Ramp behavior: Mostly neutral, with a controlled uptick

Interpretation:
- January’s conservative load created room for a meaningful stimulus
- Negative Form at week close was expected and intentional
- No signs of runaway fatigue or loss of control

---

## Weather Impact
- Frequent rain and wet roads during the week
- Several rides were opportunistic and shortened
- The week ended with mixed conditions: dry climbing followed by rainy descent

Weather shaped execution, not consistency.

---

## Bike State & Maintenance
- Rear tire (OBO Fire Bolt) and brake shoes (Baradine) continued early-life usage
- High-elevation day increased braking load under wet descent conditions
- No mechanical issues observed

Component tracking remains clean and uninterrupted.

---

## Reflection
Week 05 functioned as a bridge. Most days absorbed load quietly under poor conditions, preserving freshness. The final uphill ride reset stimulus and clearly marked the transition from January’s stabilization phase into February’s build phase.

The system handled the shift without strain.

---

## Looking Ahead
- Early February should emphasize easier days to absorb the new load
- Avoid stacking intensity immediately after the climbing stimulus
- Let Form return toward neutral before adding another hard day

> A calm week earns a hard day.  
> A hard day earns calm ones.
