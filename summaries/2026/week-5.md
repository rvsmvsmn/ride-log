# Weekly Summary — Week 05 (2026-01-26 → 2026-01-31)

## Overview
- Days ridden: 6 / 6
- Primary bike: momon105
- Theme: Transition to fitness-aware riding under heavy weather constraints

Week 05 marked the formal integration of Fitness and Weather into daily logging. Despite persistent rain and wet roads, consistency was preserved without forcing volume or intensity.

## Totals
- Total distance: ~164 km
- Total elevation: ~526 m

Daily breakdown:
- 2026-01-26: 25.57 km / 61 m  
- 2026-01-27: 25.53 km / 60 m  
- 2026-01-28: 27.85 km / 131 m  
- 2026-01-29: 25.80 km / 59 m  
- 2026-01-30: 52.55 km / 197 m  
- 2026-01-31: 6.79 km / 14 m

## Effort Distribution
- Easy / very easy: 4 days
- Steady: 2 days
- Hard (uncontrolled): 0 days

Longer or harder efforts were always contextual (group ride, social ride, weather-related pacing), never stacked.

---

## Fitness Trend
- CTL: Stable (46–47)
- Form: Mostly positive (+6 to +10)
- Ramp behavior: Neutral to slightly negative, with one brief positive uptick

Interpretation:
- Load was intentionally conservative
- Freshness was maintained despite frequent riding
- Fitness numbers aligned well with subjective feelings

---

## Weather Impact
- Rain or wet roads on most days
- Several rides opportunistically timed between rain
- One social night ride completed in dry conditions despite a wet day

Weather dictated **how** rides were executed, not **whether** they happened.

---

## Bike State & Maintenance
- Rear tire (OBO Fire Bolt) and brake shoes (Baradine) continued early-life usage
- Multiple wet-road rides increased contamination exposure
- No drivetrain issues observed due to prompt cleaning and conservative riding

Bike condition remained stable throughout the week.

---

## Reflection
Week 05 demonstrated that adding more data did not increase pressure. Fitness and Weather metrics improved explainability without influencing decision-making.

The ability to downshift volume, accept very short rides, and still close the week cleanly shows the system is resilient.

---

## Looking Ahead
- Enter February with positive Form and low accumulated fatigue
- Maintain conservative effort during wet conditions
- Allow volume to rise naturally when weather improves

> This week proved the system scales without breaking when complexity is added.
