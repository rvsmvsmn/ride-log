## Overview

- Days ridden: 7 / 7
- Primary bike: momon105
- Indoor sessions included
- Theme: Freshness peak → readiness to build

Week 09 marked the final phase of recovery consolidation and entry into a highly fresh state. Training load remained light to moderate, allowing fatigue to fall to low levels while maintaining daily riding consistency.

No structured build block began yet, but controlled intensity was reintroduced.

## Fitness Trend

Start of Week 09:
- CTL: 51
- ATL: 38
- Form: +13

End of Week 09:
- CTL: 48
- ATL: 34
- Form: +14
- Ramp: negative

Interpretation:

Fatigue continued to decline throughout the week.
Form peaked at +17 mid-week and stabilized at +14.

CTL declined gradually due to reduced structured stress.

System status:
- Fully recovered
- Highly fresh
- Slightly underloaded
- Ready for structured progression

---

## Effort Distribution

- Easy aerobic: majority
- Moderate intensity: limited (Feb 27 commute)
- Short high-end push: March 1 indoor session (controlled 171 bpm peak)

Intensity was introduced carefully and did not spike fatigue.

---

## Key Observations

1. Complete recovery from February race confirmed.
2. High-end HR reachable without instability.
3. No fatigue rebound after moderate load days.
4. CTL drift continues without structured build.
5. Form consistently positive for entire week.

This is a readiness week, not a development week.

---

## Reflection

Week 09 was stable and disciplined but intentionally light. Freshness is now high, and the body is responsive to effort. However, without increased training stress, CTL will continue to trend downward.

This week sets the platform for March progression.

---

## Looking Ahead

March should transition from freshness to controlled overload.

Recommended focus:
- Structured tempo sessions
- Muscular endurance refinement
- Gradual weekly load increase (8–12%)
- Maintain Form between -5 and +5

> Freshness is opportunity.
> Structure determines progression.
